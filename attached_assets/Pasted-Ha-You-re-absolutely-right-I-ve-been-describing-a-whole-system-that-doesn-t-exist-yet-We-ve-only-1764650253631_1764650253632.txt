Ha! You're absolutely right — I've been describing a whole system that doesn't exist yet. We've only built a pretty landing page. 😅

Let me add the **Admin Panel** to the Replit prompt. Here's the complete, updated version:

**Complete Replit Prompt:**

```
## Project: Okapi Care Network — Full Production Build

### PART 1: Font Consistency

Update the entire project to use these fonts consistently across ALL pages:
- Primary/Display: 'Cormorant' (serif) - headings, titles, hero text
- Secondary/Body: 'Jost' (sans-serif) - body text, labels, buttons, navigation
- Import: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;1,300;1,400;1,500&family=Jost:wght@300;400;500&display=swap
- Apply globally in root CSS
