## 1. COMPLIANCE SNAPSHOT ON FACILITY CARDS

Add a small compliance section to each facility card showing:
- License status (Active/Inactive)
- Violations count in last 24 months
- Last inspection date with pass/fail indicator

Example:
"License: Active • 0 Violations (24 mo) • Last Inspection: Oct 2025 ✓"

This should appear below the TRUST section on each card.
