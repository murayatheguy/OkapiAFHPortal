# OKAPI AFH PORTAL + OKAPI ACADEMY
## Complete Build Specification

This is a two-sided marketplace with three user types:
1. FAMILIES searching for care facilities
2. AFH OWNERS managing their facility listings and staff
3. CAREGIVERS completing training and managing their credentials

## START WITH PHASE 1

Please build Phase 1 first (Family-Facing Search). 

Create:
1. Landing page with search
2. Search results page with mock facility data
3. Facility detail page

Use mock/seed data for facilities (create 5-10 sample AFHs in Washington State with realistic data).

Once Phase 1 is working, I'll ask you to add Phase 2.
After You Paste This
Tell Replit Agent:
"Start with Phase 1 only. Build the landing page, search results, and facility detail page with mock data. Don't build the other phases yet."
